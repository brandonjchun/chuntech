        <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>My perceived self-worth throughout life has definitely been 
                entirely dependent on how beautiful the women I surround myself 
                with are. Therefore, in commemoration of the sexiest women of my life, I
                have decided to create a Hall of Fame. Just as a disclaimer,
                these women are not ranked in any particular order. Do not worry, I would 
                smash them all, indiscriminately.

                <p> The hardest women I've had to pursue to this day. I have neverending love
                    for her even though I feinted going for her during prom just as a way for
                    me to slide into her best friend. You're extremely cute although somewhat
                     self-absorbed at times. Still, if we ever get married I'll still break your
                     back every night and we will have the next computer science superstar.

                    potential I have had the misfortune of witnessing to this day. I hope your
                    personal ambitions are never realized and that you will turn to me when you, 
                    are at your lowest point, begging for me to take you back, at which point I 
                    will simply laugh at you and move along with my life. Still sexy asf tho :)

                <p> My long-lost love. First saw her when taking my SAT test but JP brought her
                    to me for Senior year homecoming. However, she also broke my heart in Senior 
                    year, but I still love her to this day. You have a fat ass and therefore I 
                    hope we get married in the near future. Also, I realized I have a thing for
                    volleyball girls. Must be the fact that all volleyball girls have a fat ass.

                    with her.
